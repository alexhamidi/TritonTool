First the basics, piezoelectricity, microfluidics, acoustics, and device metrology. Then, new physics arising from the unusually large accelerations (10^7 to 10^9 m/s^2) induced by acoustic waves. Finally, how various phenomena of acoustofluidics at small scales can be used in designing practical devices.",
